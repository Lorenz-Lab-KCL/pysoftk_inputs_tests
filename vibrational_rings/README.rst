Vibrational analysis
-------------------------

In this folder, one can find the vibrational analysis of three different molecules used to create circular topologies. 
The vibrational calculations have been performed with GFN2-XTB, whereas the optimizations have been performed with Universal
Force Fields as implemented in RDKit.
