Vibrational analysis
-------------------------

In this folder, one can find the vibrational analysis of three different molecules used to create circular topologies. 
The vibrational calculations have been performed with GFN2-XTB, whereas the optimizations have been performed with Universal
Force Fields as implemented in RDKit.

Folders are:

1. Benzene_ring20 (ring of 20 benzene molecules).
2. Benzene_ring_5 (ring of 5 benzene molecules).
3. Benzene_ring_8 (ring  of 8 benzene molecules).
4. Silanol (ring of 4 silanol molecules)
